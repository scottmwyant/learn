# C# (.Net)

Probably the most popular language for working with Microsoft's .NET Framework, C# supports object oriented programming, strong typing, and polymorphism.

Microsoft markets C# as a general-use language.  I find the language feels like it comes with quite a bit of "overhead".  Although it is one of my personal favorites, I struggle to consider it for light duty uses.  In my opinion, it really feels like it is made for large systems and complex applications.

Tools like Python, NodeJS and maybe even TypeScript are really more fit for purpose when I consider what I find myself doing most often.  That said, C# and Visual Studio are incredible nice tools to work with and after spending some time in that ecosystem, a lot of other languages can feel quick and dirty.

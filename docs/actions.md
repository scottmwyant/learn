# GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is GitHub's brand for their dev-ops platform. Development operations, or "dev-ops" is the practice of compressing or combining developmental and operational responsibilities of IT. Generally, in the past, development teams were responsible for creating new features and operations teams were responsible for deploying software and keeping it alive.  Deploying for example, would require someone to get the latest source code on a build machine, run the build and get it to production.  Now, in the dev-ops world, these steps can all be done with code.

Note that concepts used in GitHub Actions and even some of the GUI elements are very similiar to Azure Pipelines platform. This is  undoubtedly due to the fact that these platforms are both developed in Redmond.

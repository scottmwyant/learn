# Regular Expressions

A regular expression, regex or regexp is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. Usually such patterns are used by string searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, or for input validation. It is a technique developed in theoretical computer science and formal language theory. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)

# Learn

This repository contains reference material, links and resources for learning a number of different standards and technologies related to modern software development.

The target audience includes anyone who would like to get acquainted with a topic for the first time or reminded of the applicable format and syntax.

I've included, for beginners, a paragraph at the top of each main page describing the topic from a high level perspective.  I've also attempted to describe how topics are related.
